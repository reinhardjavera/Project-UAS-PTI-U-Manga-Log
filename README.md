U-Manga Log is a website developed as a final project for the Intro to Internet Technology course at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara. As the front-end developer, I created an intuitive interface to help users find detailed information on various manga titles. Designed for manga enthusiasts, the site features a search bar for manga lookup and highlights trending titles. The platform integrates the Jikan API (for MyAnimeList) and uses libraries such as Swiper and Axios to deliver an engaging user experience.
